    <p>And, did you know your VIP Priority Access Pass is transferable? In other words, if you can't use it on a specific day, you can offer it to someone else to use for a specific show or a specific day, etc. But be sure to get it back, because only one pass will be issued per voucher with no exceptions.</p>
    <p>All venues have limited capacities. With a VIP Priority Access Pass, please note that your access to shows is based on available capacity, but does include priority access for the larger, indoor band venues.
