    <h3 class="mom-callout">Our Story</h3>

    <p>
        Americana and Appleton became acquainted with each other a long time ago, and it didn't take long for the two to become synonymous. 
        Mile of Music 2013 was a huge success, featuring over 100 artists converging on Downtown Appleton to make music, 
        build community and send a soulful message through story and song at more than 40 venues, from the Spatio at Spats to the 
        harmonious sanctuary known as the Lawrence Memorial Chapel - oh, and just about everywhere in between.
